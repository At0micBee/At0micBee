# Personal information

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ORCID-0000--0001--7239--6700-informational?style=flat-square&logo=orcid&logoColor=A6CE39&color=86AE19)](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7239-6700)

I am Dr. H.G. Vivien, a research engineer at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille (LAM).

I work on exoplanets detection and characterization, mostly on ESA's CHEOPS mission, and in preparation of the PLATO spacecraft.

I am a (mostly) self taught scientific programmer, and my thesis work is the creation and a deep learning method to detect exoplanet transits in unfiltered photometry data.

Most of my work is directed towards scientific endeavors, but I have also dabbled in a few other projects. My specialties are building models, simulation tools, as well as data analysis.

## My education and experience

I have a bachelor degree in physics and chemistry, a master degree in fundamental physics with a specialization in astrophysics, and also a master degree in business intelligence.

I have had experiences working in research laboratories as both a modeler, a data analyst, as even an experimentalist in the preparation of Earth's atmosphere observation missions.

I created and am currently maintaining one of the most complete scientific crate for the Rust language ([Scilib](https://crates.io/crates/scilib)), and I am involved in the improvement of many different scientific numerical models.

## My main languages

I am mostly proficient in Rust and Python, a lot of experiences with Fortran, and knows the basis of C and C++.
