I am Dr. H.G. Vivien, a post-doc at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille (LAM).

I work on exoplanets detection and characterization, mostly on ESA's CHEOPS mission, and in preparation of the PLATO spacecraft.

Most of my work is directed towards scientific endeavors, but I have also dabbled in a few other projects. My specialties are building models, simulation tools, as well as data analysis.

## My education and experience

I have a bachelor's degree in physics and chemistry, a master's degree in fundamental physics with a specialization in astrophysics, and also a master's degree in business intelligence.

My Ph.D thesis was focused on the creation of a deep learning method to detect exoplanet transits in unfiltered photometry data.

I have had experiences working in research laboratories as a modeler, a data analyst, and even an experimentalist in various astrophysical fields from Earth sciences to exoplanets.

I created, and am currently maintaining, one of the most complete scientific crate for the Rust language ([Scilib](https://crates.io/crates/scilib)), and I am involved in the improvement of many different scientific numerical models.

I am mostly proficient in Rust and Python, a lot of experiences with Fortran, and knows the basis of C and C++.
