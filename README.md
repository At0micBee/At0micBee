# Personal information

My name is H.G. Vivien, and I am a (mostly) self taught scientific programmer.

Most of my work is directed towards scientific endeavors, but I have also dabbled in a few other projects. My specialty is building models and simulation tools, as well as data analysis.

## My education and experience

I am a PhD candidate at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille (LAM), working on a machine learning pipeline for the ESA Plato mission.

I hold a bachelor degree in physics and chemstry, a master degree in fundamental physics with a specialization in astrophysics, and obtained a master degree in business intelligence during the Covid pandemic.

I have had experience working in research laboratories working as both a data analyst and modeler, as well as conducting theoretical and experimental work.

I created and am currently maintaining one of the most complete scientific crate for the Rust language (![Scilib](https://github.com/At0micBee/scilib)), and I am involved in the improvement of many different scientific numerical models.
